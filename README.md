# Image-Colour-Histogram-Matching

## Colour Histogram Matching is an Image Processing technique involving two Images.

### 1. Each Image has its own and unique Colour Histogram depending on the colours, brightness, contrast of the Image.
### 2. This code provides an easy way where an input image can be transformed according to the Colour Histogram of the reference Image.
### 3. Initially the input Image's Histogram is equalized by employing certain different mathematical methods such as CDF, PDF and corresponding equalized pixel level is calculated for each previous pixel level and their value is changed accordingly.
### 4.Next the Reference Image's Colour Histogram is equalized.
### 5. Finally a mapping is found out between the equalized pixels of the Input Image and the equalized pixels of the Reference Image.
### 6. The pixel values of the Input Image are changed accordingly where the aim of Matching Colour Histogram of Style Image with Reference Image is achieved.
